# TTPx

_This is an experiment in creating something useful with AI coding agents. It is a personal hobby project, with no commitments and no promises._

TTPx is a platform for internal Red Teams to plan and analyze their operations. The features and functionality are designed with their specific needs in mind, such as:

- Integrating the concept of threat actors and crown jewels into all operations - who is being emulated, what is being targeted, and how is that trending over time?
- Producing visually appealing artifacts from individual operations, such as attack heatmaps and interactive flow charts that allow the operator to design meaningful attack narratives.
- Tracking defensive outcomes in the context of full-scale Red Team operations - not just detection and prevention but also attribution, including log sources and timing.
- Deep integration into MITRE ATT&CK and STIX 2.1 standards - including importing attack campaigns and threat actor profiles directly from MITRE or from other STIX-based threat intelligence sources.
- RBAC with group restrictions, allowing teams to work on operation planning in stealth before providing visibility to other platform users.

## Contributing

Not currently accepting pull requests - still just an experiment.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for engineering standards.

## Tech Stack

Initially based on the T3 Stack - Next.js, tRPC, Prisma, TypeScript. Type-safe APIs, server-side rendering, and component-driven design.

Local development uses sqlite and the node server. "Production" installation uses docker-compose, postgres, and BYO-reverse-proxy.

Authentication is all passwordless using NextAuth - with an option for passkeys and/or OAuth providers (initial support includes Google SSO).

## Licensing
