# Roadmap

Maybe nothing. Maybe things like:

- REST API (probably by adding `trpc-openapi` as everything is already defined as tRPC)
- Import STIX bundles from filesystem (it already imports them from the repo, not a big lift)
- AI integration via either:
  - Bundled MCP (can speak to tRPC endpoints)
  - Integrated chat
